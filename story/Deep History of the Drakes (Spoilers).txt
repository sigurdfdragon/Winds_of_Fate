-- Time of Beginning --
Before two and a half million years ago.
The oldest time Drakes remember, when Irdya was in its natural fiery state.
Creatures native to Irdya thrive in this time; Arkhai (Fire Guardians) in the skies and trolls deep underground.
Drakes and other dragons thrive at Irdya's poles.


-- Time of Fate --
Begins two and a half million years ago.
Cataclysmic cooling of Irdya through the appearance of the Mists (Will of the Wisp).
Coinciding appearances of otherworldly flora and fauna from elsewhere- saurians, naga, mermish, orcs, dwarves, humans, and many others.
Fae creatures appear soon thereafter, enchanted into being from these creatures- the woses from trees, the elves from humans, the nix from mermish.
Arkhai greatly diminish in size and power and retreat to fiery sanctuaries underground and near volcanoes. Most Drakes move from the poles to the equator. Trolls begin to surface from the deep.


-- Time of Legend --
Begins twenty two thousand years ago.
Irdya begins to warm with a slight waning of the enchanted Mists, through the feeble yet concerted efforts of the Arkhai.
Drakes come to rule over a great civilization of several races (themselves, Saurians and Dwarves), with toolworks unmatched in all later time.
A second civilization emerges shortly thereafter, of one race (Humans) with a likewise unmatched knowledge of magic, taught to them by the Arkhai.
An Arkhe further teaches the secrets of unlife to this second civilization and the practice of this art begins to consume the magical Mists that shroud Irdya, causing deserts and seas to grow.
Famine leads to a war between the two civilizations, which lasts two thousand years until a drake surrender.



-- Time of Turmoil --
Begins eleven thousand years ago.
Six thousand years of peace ensues, yet the famines grow more frequent as the deserts expand, until the practicers of unlife are too weak to stand against the fae creatures that rise to defend the Mists.
The victorious fae creatures then turn to rampage against all other races, stirred by the will of the fae. Nearly all drakes are swept from the great continent and dwarves are driven underground.
Finally, an alliance of drakes, dwarves and humans defeat the fae on the old continent and drive them into the sea. They leave behind the Ruby of Fire, captured by the Drake Dominant Morogor.
Dominant Morogor betrays the alliance by attacking humanity after their Lich-Lord Lenvan steals the Ruby from him. He with his followers are likewise outcast into the sea by the alliance.
