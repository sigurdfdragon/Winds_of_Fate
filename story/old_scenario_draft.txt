Part 3: The Nest

* Scenario 10: Fire Meets Steel
  * The Recorder tells us that, unknown to Galun, one of his Sky Drake 
    volunteers was a spy for the Flight of Kerath. It disappears with 
    several bags of provisions. No attempt was made on the breeding pens, so it 
    becomes apparent to Galun that he must have gone back to Morogor. 
  * Dwarves living in the region investigate the intruders. 
  * Drake arrogance and dwarven stubbornness do not mix well.  Battle ensues.
  * Dwarves have gryphon riders in this scenario.

* Scenario 11: Confrontation
  * The Flight of Kerath attacks. Now Galun must fight his own kind in true war.
  * On victory, the Recorder of Kerath is captured; he and Galun meet
    for the second time.  The Recorder reminds Galun that the lesser
    races reproduce more quickly than do Drakes.

* Scenario 12:  Epilog
  * Story only
  * Galun's descendants must walk a tightrope between expanding
    too slowly (and falling prey to more aggressive drakes) and
    coming into destructive contact with the fast-breeding lesser
    races.
  * Galun proclaims the Edicts: (1) an end to slaveholding, (2) avoidance
    of confrontation with other speaking peoples, (3) use the long
    sleeps to cut food requirements.
  * Ultimately, the Drake Way will require expansion off Irdya itself.
