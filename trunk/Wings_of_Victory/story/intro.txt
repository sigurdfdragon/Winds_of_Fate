My name is Reshan'lo the scrollkeeper in the tribe of Kerath.
This is during the 14th hetching in the 5th periode of the rising fire.

(Translation: The time is after the main vulcan of their archipeal has had an eruption for the 5th time since the beginning of the known drake history.
The second time variable is tribe dependent. 
The time is in the period between the 14th and 15th generation of drake eggs was breeded after the last breakout by the tribe of Kerath.)

I have to report from the greatest mistake of Kerath, his downfall and with him my own.
  
Since ages the brooderhood of Fire, which member I can call me, watches the cycles of the great fire in the sky and the appeareance of the trees downfall.
For more than 50 cycles now the downfall of the trees came earlier and earlier during the cycle and leave the northern tribes with fear.

The wisest drakes the brootherhood had brought above discussed the matter and came to only one conclusion.
We had to drop the cult of swarming and leave some of the breed abandomned, get fewer on our count.

Since more and more behives have come to end and be abandomned when failing to take the rough northern shores our goal seemed to be in reach... 

But at that time the tribe of Verkon raised a drake to dangerous in mind not ment to arise his wings above the others.
That drake forecasted the existence of great lands over the water and dreamed to bring the swarming on.

He believed that the lands where bent like fur can thrown around an egg.
For long we spread the speak of the "end of the world" lying behing the oceans for only one reason:
We believed to knew better. Research in the lines of stars had told us the world being shaped like an egg.

What promised swarming land to them was our greatest fearings:
A round world would be limited in space as well and therefore only lead to more starvation at the end.

That swarm had to be taken out for our species fate.
